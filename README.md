# NULL-MANIFESTO
NULL MANIFESTO is a facetious take on the task of writing a personal artist manifesto. I initially struggled with this assignment, feeling that writing a manifesto for my current self as an artist was both forced and egotistical. Instead, I approached the task through the lens of asemic writing, where text lacks specific semantic meaning.

Inspired by obfuscation techniques, I considered a reversal of the Dadaist cut-up method, removing words entirely to leave only the medium itself. However, I opted for an approach that retained structure while systematically stripping away meaning. The title NULL MANIFESTO had been in my notes for a while — “null” embodies concepts of absence, invalidity, and negation, aligning with my stance on the task. My favorite definition from the Cambridge Dictionary is: “To remove the effect of one thing by doing another thing that has the opposite effect.” In a more literal sense, “null” also means containing nothing or only zeros, which defines the manifesto’s content.

**Process**
1.	Text Generation: I generated 23 paragraphs of meaningless lorem ipsum text.
2. Transformation: Using InDesign’s find and replace tool, I replaced every character with a zero.
3. Web Implementation: Each paragraph was copied into an HTML file and formatted using CSS. Large padding and justified alignment introduced disrupted whitespace, creating a chaotic yet structured typographic outcome. This unpredictable formatting is reminiscent of Concrete poetry, though rather than being carefully composed by hand, it emerged from a computational process.
